* Try L2 hinge loss again, fix it
* try OVA with binary SVMs instead
    R L2
    * L1

* speed up data augmentation with multiprocessing + do it in parallel with training
    * a separate thread is probably fine, don't need a process.
    * this also allows for the launched processes to be daemonized, which makes CTRL+C behave better


* consider spectrograms with fewer frequency components... 128 may be overkill for fairly non-harmonic sounds like these. 64 or even 32 could suffice!
    * this will also speed up data augmentation

* try reducing spectrogram compression
* consider different numbers of frequency components as well

* extend build_chunk to do more augmentation:
    * additive / multiplicative noise
    * random equalization augmentation



* average over several fixed perturbations for evaluation to get a better estimate (and probably improved score)!

* confusion matrices could be very informative, compute them
* look at worst predicted examples (visualise them)

* try logistic + crossentropy again, but this time with the correct loss (i.e. not average binary crossentropy).

* add a decreasing learning rate schedule



* try 2D convolution
    * maybe + constant Q



---

* consider doing the spectrogram extraction on the GPU, with data loaded onto the GPU per batch. This might be fast enough and allows for: 
    * changing window sizes / hop sizes
    * augmentation in the time domain
        - time stretching and frequency shifting should be easier in the frequency domain though (need a time-freq representation for this anyway)
